How to Fork the Repository
Follow these steps to fork the repository:

1. Go to the Repository Page
Visit the repository's GitHub page. In this case, it’s: https://github.com/Champaranghar95/Event.

2. Fork the Repository
In the top-right corner of the repository page, you will see the "Fork" button.
Click on the "Fork" button.
GitHub will create a copy of the repository in your GitHub account.
3. Clone Your Forked Repository
Once you’ve forked the repository, you can clone it to your local machine to work on it. Here’s how:

Navigate to your forked repository on GitHub (you can find it in your GitHub profile under the "Repositories" tab).
On the right side of the page, click the "Code" button, then copy the URL (either HTTPS or SSH).
For example:

***Copy code
# https://github.com/your-username/Event.git
4. Clone the Repository to Your Local Machine
Now that you have the repository URL, open your terminal (or command prompt) and clone the repository with the following command:

bash
Copy code
# git clone https://github.com/your-username/Event.git
Make sure to replace your-username with your actual GitHub username.

5. Navigate to the Repository Directory
Once the cloning is complete, navigate to the cloned repository directory:

bash
***Copy code
# cd Event
Summary of Forking Steps:
Visit the repository on GitHub.
Click the "Fork" button in the top-right corner.
Clone the repository to your local machine using git clone.
Navigate into your local repository with cd.
Why Fork?
Forking a repository allows you to:

Create your own copy of a project.
Make changes to the project without affecting the original repository.
Work on new features, bug fixes, or improvements in your fork and then submit them back to the original repository via a Pull Request (PR).
Feel free to modify the instructions if you want to add extra details or specific project setup requirements. This should be clear enough for anyone new to Git and GitHub to follow the forking process. Let me know if you need further help!
